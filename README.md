# Description
This project is a responsive website and login feature with data collected from three API-enpoints. When logged in, the user will be directed to his/her profile page where a personal list of insurances are displayed. Frontend validation and error-snackbars will be displayed if user fails to login, or the API requests fail. On logout the user will be redirected to log in page. 

## Technologies
React.js, a declarative and component based Javascript library, is used for this project since it renders quickly thanks to the virtual DOM. Functional components and React hooks are used for this project. React also offers many libraries that facilitate the coding process. This project includes the following: 

– Emotion, CSS library that allows you to write CCS in the React component, instead of using multiple CSS-files. 

– Material UI, a React component library that offers different components based on Google's Material Design. The MUI theme feature is used to customise components and to create consistancy in the design. 

– React Router enables client side routing – updating the URL from a link click without making another request from the server.

– Axios is a promised-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and handle the transformation of request and response data.
